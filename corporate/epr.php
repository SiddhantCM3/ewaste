        <p data-aos="fade-up">In the e-waste industry, EPR (Extended Producer Responsibility) services refer to the responsibility of manufacturers, importers, and distributors of electronic products to manage the end-of-life disposal of those products. EPR programs aim to reduce the environmental impact of e-waste by encouraging the development of more sustainable product design, and by promoting the collection, recycling, and disposal of used electronic products.
