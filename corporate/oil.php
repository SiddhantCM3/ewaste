            <p data-aos="fade-up">Oil waste management refers to the process of handling, treating, and disposing of oil waste in an environmentally responsible manner. Oil waste can come from a variety of sources, including industrial activities, transportation, and household use.

                <h3>Effective oil waste management requires a multi-faceted approach that includes :</h3> <br>

                <ul>
                <li><img class="img-fluid" src="../assets/img/icons/tick.png" style="height: 2vh"> Proper storage: Store oil waste in appropriate containers that are designed to contain the waste and prevent leakage. These containers should be labeled and stored in a secure location away from potential sources of ignition.</li>
                <li><img class="img-fluid" src="../assets/img/icons/tick.png" style="height: 2vh"> Segregation of waste: Separate different types of oil waste, such as used motor oil and cooking oil, to prevent contamination and facilitate recycling or disposal.</li>
                <li><img class="img-fluid" src="../assets/img/icons/tick.png" style="height: 2vh"> Recycling: Oil waste can often be recycled or reused. For example, used motor oil can be re-refined and used as a lubricant or fuel. Cooking oil can be recycled into biodiesel or used to produce animal feed.</li>
                <li><img class="img-fluid" src="../assets/img/icons/tick.png" style="height: 2vh"> Treatment: In some cases, oil waste may require treatment before disposal. Treatment processes may include filtration, sedimentation, and chemical treatments.</li>
                <li><img class="img-fluid" src="../assets/img/icons/tick.png" style="height: 2vh"> Disposal: If recycling or treatment is not possible, oil waste must be disposed of properly. Depending on the type of waste, disposal options may include landfills, incineration, or deep well injection.</li>
                </ul>



                <p class="fst-italic">
